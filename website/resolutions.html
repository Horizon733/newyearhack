        <p>There’s a proverb, “When diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. When diet is correct, medicine is of no need.” It states a healthy diet is very important to keep the disease away.
            Good health is a divine gift from God, and ensuring its safety is our duty. The wrong food habit causes health decay, which consequently increases the needs of medicine.
            A healthy diet plan is very important when you want to get good health without having any medicine. The doctors also suggest planning a proper diet and maintaining it to avoid medicine.
